# Install Node.js

<p className="text-xl">Contributing to React Strict DOM requires Node.js and npm. The following guide will help you determine if you have the correct versions installed and available.</p>

## Version requirements

RSD currently requires Node.js version `>=20.11` and npm version `>=10` be installed.

Check the current version of Node.js and npm on your development machine. If they do not match the above requirements, you will need to update your installations.

```
$ node --version
v20.17.0
```

```
$ npm --version
10.8.2
```

## Download

[Download Node.js (LTS)](https://nodejs.org/en) and install it if you don't have the appropriate versions installed. (npm will be installed at the same time.)

Make sure the location of the newly-installed version of Node.js matches the one in your `PATH`, for example:

```
$ which node
/usr/local/bin/node
```

You will now be able to run the tasks and workflows needed to contribute.
