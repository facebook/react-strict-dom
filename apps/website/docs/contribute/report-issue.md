# Report an issue

<p className="text-xl">Reporting an issue is an easy way to help improve React Strict DOM.</p>

Before opening an issue, please search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/facebook/react-strict-dom/issues) to make sure your issue hasn't already been reported.

:::tip

If you encounter an issue, spending a little time debugging it locally can help you determine if React Strict DOM is at fault. The extra context you provide not only helps maintainers resolve issues faster, but is a great way to learn more about how RSD works in order to become an effective code contributor.

## What makes a good report?

When you report an issue, you will be prompted to complete a GitHub template of the information needed. (Please note that your issue may be closed if it doesn't include the information requested in the issue template.)

A good report provides plenty of context that allows maintainers to reproduce and understand the issue. For example:

* Details about the environment (package versions, browser, etc.)
* An isolated test case.
* Clear instructions on how to reproduce the problem.
* Screenshots for visual issues.

## Upvote an issue

If you find an existing issue that you have encountered, please use the "thumbs up" reaction on an issue in order to upvote it. This valuable signal helps maintainers sort and prioritize future work.

## Security issue

Meta has a [bounty program](https://www.facebook.com/whitehat/) for the safe disclosure of security bugs. In those cases, please go through the process outlined on that page and do not file a public issue.
