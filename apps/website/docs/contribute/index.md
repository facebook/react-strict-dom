# How to contribute

<p className="text-xl">Welcome to the engineering manual for contributors to React Strict DOM. This section explains how to contribute, step-by-step.</p>

React Strict DOM uses GitHub issues and pull requests to manage all contributions. Engineers at Meta will sync from GitHub to Meta's internal repositories ([see Meta-only instructions](https://fburl.com/wiki/5mrca4uf)).

## Code of conduct

This project expects all participants to adhere to Meta's OSS [Code of Conduct](https://opensource.fb.com/code-of-conduct/). Please read the full text.

## Ways to contribute

Thank you for your interest in contributing! All contributions are welcome. Whether that is by reporting issues and contributing code or by commenting on issues, reviewing PRs, and joining discussions.

* [Issues](https://github.com/facebook/react-strict-dom/issues)
* [Pull Requests](https://github.com/facebook/react-strict-dom/pulls)
* [Discussions](https://github.com/facebook/react-strict-dom/discussions)
* [Changelog](https://github.com/facebook/react-strict-dom/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)

Another key way to contribute is by adding web capabilities directly to [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), and improving the integration with [Expo](https://expo.dev/).

* [React Native requirements](https://github.com/facebook/react-strict-dom/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22cannot+polyfill%22%2C%22bug%3A+react-native%22)
* [Contributing to React Native](https://reactnative.dev/contributing/overview)
* [Expo requirements](https://github.com/facebook/react-strict-dom/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22bug%3A+expo%22)
* [Contributing to Expo](https://github.com/expo/expo/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

Examples of RSD capabilities that originate from contributions to React Native include [PointerEvent](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2022/12/13/pointer-events-in-react-native), [DOM traversal APIs](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/blob/main/proposals/0607-dom-traversal-and-layout-apis.md), [Event Loop](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/blob/main/proposals/0744-well-defined-event-loop.md), CSS boxShadow, and CSS filters.
