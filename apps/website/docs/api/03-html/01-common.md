# Common components (e.g., \<html.div>)

<p className="text-xl">The majority of HTML components support the following common props and events.</p>

## Overview

All supported HTML components are available on the `html` export (which can be aliased). For the full list of supported HTML components, please refer to the [HTML compatibility table](/api/html/#compatibility). Component props are strictly typed and will provide errors if invalid values are used.

```jsx
import { html } from 'react-strict-dom';

const Foo = () => {
  return (
    <html.main>
      <html.section>
        <html.article>
          <html.h1>Title</html.h1>
          <html.div>
            <html.p>
              Paragraph of <html.span>text</html.span> element
            </html.p>
          </html.div>
        </html.article>
      </html.section>
    </html.main>
  )
}
```

One of the most significant ways in which React Strict DOM elements differ from those in React DOM, is the `style` attribute. The `style` attribute only accepts styles created with the `css` export, and those styles can be (conditionally) merged in order by combining them using an array.

```jsx
import { css, html } from 'react-strict-dom';

const styles = css.create({
  avatar: {...},
  highlighted: {...}
});

<html.img
  style={[
    styles.avatar,
    highlighted && styles.highlighted
  ]}
/>
```

## Props

Please refer to the [related React DOM docs](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/common) and [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes) for further details about each of the supported attributes listed below. Capture-phase event props are not supported in React Strict DOM. It is expected that developers use the EventTarget API for working with the capture phase.

### Common

* `aria-*` - Excludes all abstract roles that should not be used by authors.
* `autoCapitalize`
* `autoFocus`
* `children`
* `data-*`
* `data-testid` - This is a special-cased data attribute that is used as a test selector.
* `dir`
* `elementTiming`
* `enterKeyHint`
* `hidden`
* `id`
* `inert`
* `inputMode`
* `lang`
* `role` - The synonym `presentation` is not supported, use `none`.
* `ref`
* `spellCheck`
* `style` - Accepts a style or array of styles created using `css.create()` and `css.createTheme()`. Falsey values are ignored. Order matters, with later declarations overriding earlier ones.
* `tabIndex` - Only supports `0` and `-1` values.

### Events

* `onAuxClick`
* `onBlur`
* `onClick`
* `onContextMenu`
* `onCopy`
* `onCut`
* `onFocus`
* `onFocusIn`
* `onFocusOut`
* `onFullscreenChange`
* `onFullscreenError`
* `onGotPointerCapture`
* `onKeyDown`
* `onKeyUp`
* `onLostPointerCapture`
* `onPaste`
* `onPointerCancel`
* `onPointerDown`
* `onPointerEnter`
* `onPointerLeave`

* `onPointerOut`
* `onPointerOver`
